# **Math Kit Workspace Cards**


This whole project has been done using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python.

<br>


## **Calculator**

This workspace card is uses a regular calculator for performing simple and a bit more advanced operations, using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python and the [**math**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) library in Python for performing mathematical operations.

While keeping track of the history of the operations, and allowing the user to go back to the previous operations, and clear the result to perform another one.

Whilst the Enter button is used to perform the operation.

Given the options of the calculator, the user can choose to perform the following operations:

    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Square Root
    - Log
    - Trigonometric Functions
    - Hyperbolic Trigonometry

## **Plotter**

This workspace card is used to plot the graph of an equation that the user enters, using the [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/) library, with the help of [**NumPy**](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/) in Python.

This workspace offers the user the option to plot the graph of an equation, and the user can also choose to plot the graph of a function of x, or the graph of a function of y.

## **Convertor**

This workspace card is used to perform unit conversions between various common units of measurements, using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python and the [**Pillow**](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) library in Python.

## **Randomizer**

This workspace card is used to generate random lists and numbers for a given input entered by the user, using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python, the [**random**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) library in Python and the [**NumPy**](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/) library in Python.
