# **Math Kit Workspace Cards**


The Math-Kit project was done using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python, to make it a GUI desktop app, and not a console-based app or a web app.

<br>

## **Calculator**

This workspace card deploys a regular calculator for performing simple and a bit more advanced operations, using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python and the [**math**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) library in Python for performing mathematical operations.

While keeping track of the history of the operations, and allowing the user to go back to the previous operations, or clearing the result to perform another one.

Whilst the Enter button is used to carry out the mathematical operation.

Given the options of the calculator, the user can choose to perform the following operations:

    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division
    - Square Root
    - Log
    - Trigonometric Functions
    - Hyperbolic Trigonometry

## **Plotter**

This workspace card was made using [**matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/) library, with the help of [**NumPy**](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/) in Python and [**csv**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) for the data set.


It's used to plot the graph of either:
   
    1. A data set from a csv file that the user can import.
    2. Or an entered polynomial equation.

while providing the user with the option to save the graph as an image, in addition to plotting the graph with two different ways:

    1. bar plot
    2. line plot

## **Convertor**

This workspace card was made using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python and the [**Pillow**](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) library in Python.

It performs unit conversions between a couple of common quantities, such as: length and temperature. And as one of them is chosen, the user can choose is given the pre-defined units of measurement, and the user can choose to convert the chosen unit into another unit of measurement from the same category or quantity set.

## **Randomizer**

This workspace card is used to generate random lists for a given input entered by the user, using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python, the [**random**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) library in Python and the [**NumPy**](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/) library in Python.

One other feature of this workspace is that it allows adding, deleting, picking a random item to the list, and clearing the list.
