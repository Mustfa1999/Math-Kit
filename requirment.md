# **Requirements**

# **Vision**

Math-Kit is a project that aims to provide a platform for the user to perform various mathematical operations without having to leave the comfort of their own computer. And that was made possible by using the [**tkinter**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library for the GUI in Python, which helped us make Math-Kit to be a GUI desktop app, and not a console-based app or a web app.

# Functional Requirements

_The program will automaticlly update the content of data when it run
the user can search all of champions data and appiltys as well as items benefits_

# Non-Functional Requirements

_Testability for rules function as well as update function_
_the test in our application will comapre the function which is responible for creating the content file with the function which will preview the rules of the game to the user
and another test will compair the function which will create the update file content with the function which will be responseble for previewing the updates on the game for the user_
